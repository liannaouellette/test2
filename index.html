    <p class="div">What is a meal plan?</p>

    <br>
    <p class="purple">A meal plan is a seven-day program <br> in which you put together a list of <br> foods suiting your pallet with the <br> idea of having your best nutritional <br> needs in mind. A meal plan may be <br> followed by certain people with a <br> specific objective in mind, such as <br> losing weight, lowering cholesterol <br> improvements, achieving nutritional <br> targets, saving time, etc. There are <br> also others such as athletes and <br> such who create a meal plan <br> to ensure they get enough nutrients <br> to perform. There are different types <br> of meal plans, some make their decisions <br> based on a specific health condition <br> they have, such as diabetes and so forth. <br> Meal plans are created generally by <br> dietitians or health care workers, but <br> lately creating meal plans at home is on <br> a rise. As time progresses, people are <br> starting to become more and more aware <br> of their health and meal planning is a <br> way to ensure that they  stay on track.

    <p class="ok">Some meal plan considerations:</p>

    <p  class="div1">When making a meal plan, there are things you should consider before taking your first step towards choosing your meals For Example repetition is key in the creation of a meal plan. That being said, you can mix it up occasionally. You don't need to eat the same meals every day. I’d recommend choosing 2-3 different breakfast, lunch and dinner meals to eat throughout the week while mixing in some healthy and satisfying snacks. Switching up your source of protein can allow for some variety in your meal plan. Switching it up between chicken, eggs, beans, meats, protein powder etc, can allow your meal plans to be versatile while still getting that satisfaction you’ve been looking for. Cooking in bulk is another thing you should consider before meal planning. If you're all set for the week and are planning on having oatmeal with fruits 3 mornings throughout the week, instead of making it every morning, spend a couple extra minutes to prepare your meals in advance and store it in your fridge until you are ready to eat it. One last thing to keep in mind is that it's okay to have a cheat meal once a week. It's okay to order out and eat a burger, but you need to keep that in mind while making your meal plan because the last thing you want is to be throwing out food because you made too much.

    <p class="benefits">Benefits</p>
    <p class="purple">While for some, meal planning may <br> seem useless and a waste of time, <br> there are actually tons of benefits <br> that come with it. Everyone has their <br> own reasons for meal planning, no <br> matter their goals in which they are <br> striving to achieve, everyone can <br> find meal plans beneficial. Having <br> your meals for the week planned and <br> ready to prepare can spare countless <br> thoughts about what to eat, and the <br> stress and loss of time cooking and <br> planning meals come with. This could <br> especially be beneficial for people <br> who work long hours, manage health <br> conditions such as diabetes, or with <br> family to feed. Furthermore, meal <br> plans can help you have a healthier <br> food selection and fix your eating <br> habits. It is scientifically proven <br> that  when we are hungry and our <br> blood sugar levels drop  we tend to <br> impulsively buy food that we enjoy <br> as pizza or hot dogs out of convenience. <br> With meal plans and a proper grocery list,<br> you will be sticking to the healthier <br> alternatives such as vegetables, whole <br> grains and beans in comparison to the <br> healthier alternatives such as chicken, <br> rice and beans. There’s no doubt that eating <br> healthier is beneficial for everyone, <br> but it is especially beneficial for <br> those with type 2 diabetes or heart <br> problems. Having a meal plan to stick <br> to can lessen the stress put upon <br> consumers and make eating healthy an <br> experience far more enjoyable and less <br> overwhelming. </p>

    <p class="Shopping-tips">Shopping Tips</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a grocery list handy in the kitchen and jot down what you need as soon as you run out. Before taking a trip to the store, take note of what you already have and only buy what you need. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Avoid shopping when you are hungry to prevent any impulse purchases and overbuying. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Most grocery stores keep the most expensive (and sometimes least healthy) options on the shelves at eye level. Explore the entire shelf before deciding on what to buy. Often, a generic brand of any product can be found nearby and is less expensive.  
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>When running low on fresh ingredients, try experimenting with different combinations of shelf-stable foods. For example, adding canned tuna and frozen broccoli to boxed macaroni and cheese is an easy balanced meal! Turn a can of beans into a burrito bowl by combining it with rice, salsa, cheese, and lettuce or sautéed peppers.  </li>
        <li>Keep an eye out for when pantry items are on sale and stock up! </li>
        <br>
        <li>Maintain an organized pantry by storing grains and dried legumes in clear jars. Try keeping similar items, such as baking ingredients, in a basket or separate drawer.  
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Where you shop matters. Stores such as maxi and IGA are great for having better prices and deals, as well as fresh produce. Try to mix in a monthly trip to Costco to buy your bulk items such as olive oil, oats, and flour can save some extra money while you're at it. That way, you will be able to spend your budget on a couple specialty items. Here’s a list of tips I made to help you out with your shopping experience.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Determine how much you can afford to spend on groceries each week or over a period of time. This will help you stick to your budget
